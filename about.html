<p>My name is Josh Kingston and I'm the fund manager at <a href="http://www.kingstoncarnegie.com/">Kingston Carnegie</a>. I practice a type of investing called "value investing". This blog is an outlet for the ideas and insights generated whilst conducting the fundamental research that value investing admonishes.</p>

<p>It is in the interest of the financial media and the financial industry to make finance seem complex to the public in order to sell more media and more financial services. It's my goal to show that finance is not always so complex and that the common sense approach advocated by value investors can give quiet simplicity in a market dominated by superfluous noise</p>
